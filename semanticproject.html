           <h2>Horses</h2> 
           <p>
            Horses are my favourite animal.
            Horses are magnificent creatures with a long history of companionship with humans.<br>
            Their powerful build, graceful movements, and intelligent nature have captivated people for centuries.<br>
            These herbivores are social animals, thriving in herds with complex social structures.<br> 
            Horses possess a keen sense of hearing and sight, allowing them to navigate their surroundings and communicate with each other effectively.<br> 
            They are known for their ability to learn and bond with humans, making them ideal partners for riding, racing, and other equestrian activities.<br>
            More information on horses lies below.
